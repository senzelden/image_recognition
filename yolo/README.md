### Description:
The [YOLOv3 model](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) allows to detect objects in images.
The here provided bash script and python files can be used to create several predictions at once for a number of images. The implemented version expects a mp4 file in your directory from which it automatically extracts frames and in the end creates a gif.
After the installation of YOLOv3 insert the files into your darknet directory together with your video file. Then run bash yolo_gif.sh in your terminal.
